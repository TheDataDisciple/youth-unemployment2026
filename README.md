# Youth Unemployment | ILO 2026 Report

An exploration of youth unemployment using **2025 estimates published by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in August 2026**, with an Excel dataset and a Power BI Desktop project.

The project focuses on the challenges young people face when entering the labour market. **2025 in the repository name is the year measured; 2026 is the ILO report's publication year.**

**Source:** [International Labour Organization, August 2026](https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/youth-unemployment-rises-young-people-face-harder-road-decent-work). Estimates for 2025. The chart label **North, South & West Europe** abbreviates **Northern, Southern and Western Europe**.

## Project status

The final chart image, Excel dataset and editable Power BI Project (`.pbip`) are included. The `Dashboard` page contains one horizontal bar chart comparing all three observations and a card showing the worldwide unemployed youth count. The PNG exports the rate chart only; the count card is available in the editable report.

This is a static analysis of selected 2025 estimates. No public Power BI Service report is linked.

## Data snapshot

All rates below refer to people aged **15–24 in 2025**, measured as a share of the youth labour force.

| Region | Youth unemployment rate |
| --- | ---: |
| World | 12.4% |
| Northern America | 9.8% |
| Northern, Southern and Western Europe | 15.0% |

The ILO also reports approximately **67 million unemployed young people worldwide** in 2025. These figures come from the [ILO news release published on 11 August 2026](https://www.ilo.org/resource/news/youth-unemployment-rises-young-people-face-harder-road-decent-work).

## Dataset

Download [youth-unemployment.xlsx](data/youth-unemployment.xlsx). The workbook contains:

- `Data`: the three source observations in the named table `YouthUnemployment3` (`A1:E4`). Edit this sheet when updating the source data.
- `PivotSheet`: a supporting pivot view, not the report's import source.

The supplied Power BI query currently imports the entire `Data` worksheet and promotes its first row to headers. Keep this worksheet limited to the header and source records; place notes and totals elsewhere.

| Field | Data type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Region` | Text | World total or selected geographic region |
| `Year` | Whole number | Reference year: 2025 |
| `AgeGroup` | Text | Age range: 15–24 |
| `UnemploymentRate` | Decimal number | Rate stored as a fraction: `0.124` represents `12.4%` |
| `UnemployedPeople` | Whole number, nullable | Rounded world count: `67000000`; regional counts are unavailable in the cited release |

The workbook is a manually transcribed, three-row extract from the ILO release, not a complete ILO database export. Blank counts mean unavailable, not zero.

## Open the Power BI project

1. Clone or download the **entire repository**. Keep the `.Report` and `.SemanticModel` folders alongside the `.pbip` file in `data`.
2. Open [youth-unemployment-dashboard.pbip](data/youth-unemployment-dashboard.pbip) in a compatible version of Power BI Desktop. See [Microsoft's Power BI Project documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/developer/projects/projects-overview) for requirements and preview settings.
3. Before refreshing on another computer, update the Excel source path. The `Data` Power Query currently uses the author's absolute local file path. In Power Query, edit the query's `Source` step so `File.Contents(...)` points to your local `data/youth-unemployment.xlsx`.
4. Apply the query changes and refresh to load the data. The local model cache is excluded from Git, so a fresh clone needs a successful refresh.
5. Open the `Dashboard` page to view or edit the visuals.

The `Data` query imports the `Data` worksheet, assigns column types, removes `Year` and `AgeGroup`, and adds `IdRegion` to preserve the region order. It shortens the European label to `North, South & West Europe`. Full region names, year and age group remain in Excel; all current observations refer to 2025 and ages 15–24.

## Methodology and limitations

- The unemployment rate uses the youth labour force as its denominator, not all people aged 15–24.
- The world total overlaps the regional observations. Do not add the world and regional counts or sum their unemployment rates.
- The European observation covers Northern, Southern and Western Europe. It is not an EU-only or all-Europe figure.
- The dataset compares selected regions for one year. It cannot show a time trend or establish the causes of unemployment.
- Youth unemployment does not directly measure employers' experience requirements or the outcomes of all first-time job applicants.
- The source contains rounded estimates. The workbook has no automatic refresh connection.
- The supplied bar chart uses `Sum` of `UnemploymentRate` within each region. This returns the supplied values only because the current dataset has one row per region. Revisit the aggregation and restore year/age fields in the model before adding observations.
- Selecting a regional bar can filter other visuals. Regional unemployed-person counts are blank, so the count card may become blank under a regional selection; clear the selection to return to the world total.
